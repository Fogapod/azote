# Azote

**Azote** is a GTK+ 3-based picture browser and a wallpaper setter, as the frontend to the [swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) 
(Sway/Wayland) and [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org) (X windows) commands.

Also see [Azote in action on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Cjqr0LRL67I).

## Project assumptions

The most commonly used *desktop background browser and setter* is aimed at X windows, and does not work with 
[sway](https://swaywm.org). Since the `swaybg` command does everything we may need, it's enough to give it a GUI. 
In order not to limit the program usage to the single environment, Azote is also capable of using feh 
when running on i3, Openbox or other X11 window managers.

### Main features:

- works on Sway
- uses own, bigger thumbnails (240x135px)
- flips wallpapers horizontally
- splits wallpapers between 2 or more displays

## Usage

Select the folder your wallpapers are stored in. If it contains a lot of big pictures, it may take some time for
Azote to create thumbnails. It's being performed once, unless you clear the `~/.azote/thumbnails` folder.

Azote, as well as feh, saves a batch file to your home directory. It needs to be executed in order to set the wallpaper 
on subsequent logins or reboot.

### sway

Edit your `~/.config/sway/config` file. Replace your current wallpaper settings, like:

```bash
output * bg /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/Sway_Wallpaper_Blue_1920x1080.png fill
```

with:

```bash
exec ~/.azotebg
```

### X window managers (i3, Openbox, dwm etc.)

You need to execute `~/.fehbg` from your window managerâ€™s startup file.

**dwm note:**

If you start dwm from a script, it may look something like this:

```bash
# Statusbar loop
while true; do
   xsetroot -name "$( date +"%F %R" )"
   sleep 1m    # Update time every minute
done &

# Autostart section
~/.fehbg & 

exec dwm
```

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Install [azote](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/azote) from AUR.

### Debian & Ubuntu

Either download the .deb package or follow the instructions in [this link](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3AHead_on_a_Stick%3Aazote&package=azote) to add the repository and APT key.

If the repository & key are added then the package will be updated with the usual `apt update && apt upgrade` commands.

## Troubleshooting

As well pictures as displays preview are instances of the Gtk.Button class. In case you don't see images inside them,
please make sure if button images are turned on in the `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` file:

```bash
[Settings]
(...)
gtk-button-images=1
```

### X11 / feh notice

The background color picker won't be available. You'll also be unable to select different modes 
*("tile", "center", "scale", "seamless")* for certain displays. The list of modes varies from what you see in Sway 
*("scale", "max", "fill", "center", "tile")*.
